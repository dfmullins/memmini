# memmini

mEmMini is a JavaScript plugin that makes HTML tags drawable. By simply adding the mEmMini data attribute, an HTML tag, such as a div, form, or body gets wrapped in a transparent canvas for drawing and commenting on. With its light-weight user interface, mEmMini can be toggled on and off for viewing, editing, adding, and deleting drawings and comments. The drawings and comments can easily be passed for a server request and response, as well as written to a file or saved in a database. Moreover, drawings and comments can be managed locally for personal use.
